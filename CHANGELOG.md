# Changelog

All notable changes to `@dowonk-7949/llm-wiki-standard` are documented here. This
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Entries are newest-first.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-14

First stable release. `1.0.0` promotes the `0.1.8` contract to a stable 1.0
milestone with **no functional command changes**; it declares the public contract
stable and hardens release quality.

### Stability

- Declared the CLI command/option surface, `--format json` output shape, and the
  required frontmatter contract stable. Breaking changes to these now require a
  major version bump. See `GATE_REVIEW.md` ("1.0.0 Stability Milestone") and
  `docs/llm-wiki/VERSIONING.md`.

### Added

- Release-quality CI: a Node 18.18.0 / 20 / 22 / 24 × Windows / macOS / Linux
  verify matrix and a packed-tarball consumer install smoke test
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- This accumulating root `CHANGELOG.md`, shipped in the npm package.

### Notes

- The conservative write policy is unchanged: `init` / `quickstart` / `fix` write
  only under `--write`, `migrate --apply` remains blocked, `log.md` and existing
  adapter files are never overwritten, and CLI- or agent-authored docs remain
  `needs_review`.

## Earlier (0.1.x)

Pre-1.0 history is recorded in `docs/llm-wiki/log.md` and the per-release notes
under `docs/llm-wiki/releases/`. Highlights:

- `0.1.8` — scoped `fix` autofix command and evidence drift detection (`evidence.stale`).
- `0.1.7` — multi-ecosystem detection (Python/Go/Rust/JVM), Cursor and Copilot
  adapters, `llm-wiki.config.json`, and the `release-notes` command.
- `0.1.6` — real generation dates, `related.missing` and `content.not_enriched`
  validation, wiki-graph orphan detection, and the `--format html` dashboard.
